# LowCostHighPrecisionPositioning - BASE2, ROVER2

Here you can find all 3D models (SolidWorks 2019), PCB designs (KiCad) and documentation for the BASE2 and ROVER2 which have been designed during the master thesis project of Peter Verweij. <br/><br/>

The aim of this project was to create a low cost high precision positioning system for Ghana. <br/>
The showcase and explanation of the project can be found in this [showcase movie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1svl4LCIXA&feature=youtu.be&ab_channel=PeterVerweij)<br/><br/>

For the Ublox GNSS receiver configuration I refer to the work of hcwinsemius and kriete on the [RTK_GNSS github page](https://github.com/hcwinsemius/RTK_GNSS)<br/><br/>

Finally, the files and explanation to add a GPRS cellular connection to the raspberry PI can be found here aswell.<br/><br/>

It has to be noted that this project is in a prototype state. There is still a lot to be desired. For example: the custom PCBs connect prototype breakoutboards, there are no indicator lights in the devices, etcetera.
