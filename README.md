# LowCostHighPrecisionPositioning

Here you can find all 3D models, PCB designs and documentation for the BASE2 and ROVER2 which have been designed during the master thesis project of Peter Verweij. <br/><br/>

The aim of this project was to create a low cost high precision positioning system for Ghana. <br/>
The showcase and explanation of the project can be found in this [showcase movie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1svl4LCIXA&feature=youtu.be&ab_channel=PeterVerweij)<br/><br/>

For the Ublox GNSS receiver configuration I refer to the work of hcwinsemius and kriete on the [RTK_GNSS github page](https://github.com/hcwinsemius/RTK_GNSS)<br/><br/>

Finally, the files and explanation add a GPRS cellular connection on the raspberry PI can be found here aswell.
